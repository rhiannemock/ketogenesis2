                <h3 class="color-orange">Meat</h3>
                <p>Meat is a staple of the ketogenic diet. It is a great source of protein and healthy fats, which are essential for maintaining ketosis. When choosing meat, it is best to opt for unprocessed, high-quality options that are free from added sugars and preservatives.</p>
                <p>It is important to remember that a keto diet is a low carbohydrate, moderate protein and high fat diet. Too much meat can mean too much protein, so tracking your daily macronutrients is essential to stay in ketosis.</p>
                <p>Excess protein can be converted to glucose in a process called gluconeogenesis, which will hinder the body’s ability to produce ketone bodies and achieve the desired results.</p>

                <p>Here is a list of the most commonly consumed meats:</p>

                <ul>
